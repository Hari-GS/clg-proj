        <p>
          The Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI-DS) is an
          interdisciplinary field that combines Computer Science, Mathematics
          and Statistics to create intelligent System that can learn from data.
          The main goal of the department is to develop algorithms, tools and
          techniques that enable machines to perform tasks that typically
          require human intelligence such as language understanding, Image
          recognition and decision making. The department utilizes Machine
          Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep learning other advanced
          technologies to build intelligent systems that can make predictions,
          analyze data and automate process
        </p>
